# Model API

## About

A proof of concept for a web API that can export 3MF files from a parametric OpenSCAD model. A typical use would be to have a form on a website that allows users to enter the desired parameters, then submit the form to an API endpoint, allowing the user to download the generated 3MF file.

You can see an example of how this can be embedded into a webpage here: https://hanno.braun-odw.eu/notes/spacer/


## Deployment

The API is a webserver written in Rust, running in a Docker container. I chose Docker, because it provided a way to also ship OpenSCAD in the same container.

If you don't want to run your own server, there are a lot providers that host Docker containers. I've been using [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/) and I'm very happy with them.


## Usage

Build and run the development version:

```
cargo run
```

Build and run the production version:

```
docker build -t model-api .
docker run -p 80:80 model-api
```

Test API:
http://localhost/models/spacer.3mf?outer=30.0&inner=12.0&height=10.0
